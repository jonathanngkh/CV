## Your Name

I am a naive, idealistic and annoylingly cheerful asian male.
My biggest actual achievement is winning a business pitching competition that sent me on an all expense paid trip to Silicon Valley, with an idea for an app named 'Monster Strider Explorer'. My saddest achievement is 'achieving' 2nd place at a national long jump competition when I was 14. It still hurts to think about it.
I'm looking to work in an environment where I can work on nerdy and dreamy things like robots, doomsday communes and make a difference.

## Skills

#### Product Development

A year before Makers Academy, I designed and prototyped a custom skateboard sling bag. The process of getting to that point forced me to develop a keen gauge of a concept's feasibility and value. It also gave me the opportunity to learn loads about hardware design in a short amount of time, something I had previously never studied.

This ability to learn something I had no clue about in a short amount of time translated into knowing where to look for help, and having a sharp sense of what makes or break a product, be it a physical toy or code.

I am certain that bringing that prototype to my university's interview landed me a scholarship in spite of less than stellar grades.

This skill of somehow knowing which features are relevant to a product and assessing its feasability has saved the various teams I've worked with lots of time and laid the foundation for delightful working experience.

#### Clandestine Leadership

I will be the first to admit that my biggest weakness is that I am not a natural born leader. I've always had to make a conscious effort to learn leadership skills. I am highly sensitive to a group's dynamics, and have always assumed the role of a group's balancer while simultaneously steering it in the direction of a better user experience, be it in my pitching competition's team, Makers Academy project teams, controlling my platoon in the army or a Friday night party.
