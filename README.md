## Jonathan Ng

I am an idealistic and relentlessly cheerful person and will always bring a fresh perspective to any problem-solving team.

My most marketable achievement is winning a business pitching competition that sent me on an all expense paid trip to Silicon Valley, with an idea for an app named 'Monster Strider Explorer'.

My saddest achievement is 'achieving' 2nd place at a national long jump competition when I was 14. It still hurts to think about it.

I'm looking to work in an environment where I can work on nerdy and dreamy things like robots, doomsday communes. If that's not possible, it'll suffice to work at a place where I can be valued to do valuable work.

## Skills

#### Product Development

A year before Makers Academy, I designed and prototyped a custom skateboard sling bag. The process of getting to that point forced me to develop a keen gauge of a concept's feasibility and value. It also gave me the opportunity to learn loads about hardware design in a short amount of time, something I had previously never studied.

This ability to learn something I had no clue about in a short amount of time translated into knowing where to look for help, and having a sharp sense of what makes or break a product, be it a physical toy or code.

I am certain that bringing that prototype to my university's interview was what landed me a scholarship in spite of the intense competition in Singapore, on top of my A level grades (AAAB) not meeting the insane requirements.

This skill of somehow knowing which features are relevant to a product and assessing its feasability has saved the various teams I've worked with lots of time and laid the foundation for a delightful working experience.

#### Clandestine Leadership

If asked for my biggest weakness I would say that I am not a natural born leader.

I've always had to make a conscious effort to learn leadership skills. While in the army, I was trained and eventually assigned to be an infantry sergeant with troopers under my command. Despite the difference in rank and experience, I had to tread carefully with men who were older than I was, and at the end of the day, rally their spirits to achieve whatever was the mission.

I am highly sensitive to a group's dynamics, and have always assumed the role of a group's balancer while simultaneously steering it in the direction of a better user experience, be it in my pitching competition's team, Makers Academy project teams, controlling my platoon in the army or a Friday night party.
